# Future Enhancements

In the upcoming versions, we aim to implement several key features and improvements to enhance the performance and usability of our framework. Below is the list of proposed features:

## 1. GPU Support for COCO


## 2. Backward Pass Handling of Residual Connections


## 3. Winograd Algorithm Implementation


## 4. FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for Convolutions


## 5. Speed Optimization


## 6. Efficient Model Saving


## 7. Function to Load Pretrained Model from Weights in H5 Format

## 8. Easy Integration of Pretrained Models with COCO

# Potential Future Ideas

## Data Pipeline and Preprocessing Modules
## Model Saving, Loading, and Checkpointing (Callbacks)
## Automatic Differentiation (Autograd) Engine
## Advanced Model Architectures and Modules [ ViT, GNNs, Region Proposal Networks]
